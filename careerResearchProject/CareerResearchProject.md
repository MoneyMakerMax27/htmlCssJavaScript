### Data Scientist:

#### What They Do
 - **A Data Scientist is a highly analytical professional who uses a blend of statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to turn complex, raw data into valuable insights. They clean and analyze large datasets, build predictive models and machine learning algorithms, and then communicate their findings to help organizations make strategic, data-driven decisions. Their work ultimately solves business problems and forecasts future trends.**




#### Required Education & Skills
- **The minimum education typically required for a Data Scientist is a Bachelor's Degree in a quantitative field such as Computer Science, Statistics, or Mathematics. This foundational degree ensures candidates possess the necessary skills in programming, analytical thinking, and statistical methods to handle data-intensive tasks.**
- **Generally the recommended education for a Data Scientist is a Master's Degree (M.S.) in a highly quantitative field like Data Science, Computer Science, or Statistics. This advanced degree provides the deep theoretical knowledge and specialized skills, such as machine learning and statistical modeling, required for competitive roles.**
- **The key technical skills you need are centered on programming—primarily Python or R for analysis and model building, combined with SQL for data retrieval—and a strong foundation in statistics and applying various machine learning algorithms. Proficiency is also essential in using tools for data wrangling, creating clear visualizations, and leveraging cloud platforms to work with large-scale data.**


- **The most important soft skills for a Data Scientist are communication and storytelling, which allow you to clearly translate complex technical findings into actionable business insights for non-technical stakeholders. Additionally, critical thinking and intellectual curiosity are essential for defining problems, designing effective experiments, and continually learning new tools and techniques in the rapidly evolving field.** 


#### Salary Information
- **Entry-Level Salary Range: $90,000** 
- **Mid-Career Salary Range: $120,000** 
- **Senior-Level Salary Range: $200,000+** 

#### Job Outlook
- **Growth Rate (next 10 years): The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment for Data Scientists will grow by a robust 34% between 2024 and 2034, which is significantly faster than the average for all occupations. This exceptional growth is fueled by the continuous expansion of Big Data and the need for virtually all industries to develop and integrate advanced AI and Machine Learning solutions.** 
- **Demand Level: The demand level for Data Scientists is extremely high and is projected to remain so, with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasting a massive 34% job growth through 2034. Despite the high demand, the market is becoming competitive, with companies increasingly seeking specialized candidates in Machine Learning and AI to fill the skill gap, rather than generalist "unicorn" Data Scientists.** 

#### Connection to Your Coursework
Which of your current classes/skills connect to this career?

- **AI/ML: This is the core of the Data Scientist role. Senior-level work heavily involves designing, building, and deploying advanced Machine Learning models and algorithms (AI) to solve complex business problems.**

**How they connect: All these skills connect by providing the full spectrum of tools necessary to transform raw data into valuable business outcomes: Programming, SQL, and AI/ML are the core technical competencies required for every stage, from accessing and cleaning data to building and deploying complex predictive models. While Web Design is not a core requirement, the ability to create simple dashboards or interfaces helps the Data Scientist communicate their complex results to non-technical stakeholders.**
