        const birthYear = 2005;  // Why const? A person's birth year is fixed.
        const hometown = "Springfield";  // Why const? Where you were born doesn't change.
        const schoolName = "Central High"; // Why const? The name of your school is set.

        // Use let for values that will change
        let currentYear = 2025;  // Why let? The year keeps changing.
        let age = 20;  // Why let? Your age changes every year.
        let grade = 10;  // Why let? Your grade changes each school year.

        // Try to change a const - this will cause an ERROR!
